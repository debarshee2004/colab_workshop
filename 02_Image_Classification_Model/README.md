## Introduction

This repository contains an image classification/prediction model implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is designed to classify input images into one of several predefined categories. You can use this model to classify various types of images, such as handwritten digits, animals, objects, or any other category of your choice.

## Requirements

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/image-classification.git
cd image-classification
```

2. Install the required packages as mentioned in the [Requirements](#requirements) section.

## Usage

This section provides an overview of how to use the image classification model.

### Dataset

Before using the model, you need a dataset. You can either use an existing dataset or create your own. Make sure the dataset is organized into subfolders, where each subfolder corresponds to a different category, and contains image files.

Example dataset structure:

```
dataset/
    category1/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    category2/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    ...
```

### Model Architecture

The model architecture can be found in the `model.py` file. You can customize the architecture to suit your specific classification problem.

### Training

To train the model on your dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset in the structure mentioned in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.

2. Set the dataset path and other hyperparameters in the `train.py` file.

3. Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py
```

The trained model weights will be saved in the `models` directory.

### Evaluation

You can evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation script:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

This script will load the trained model and evaluate its accuracy on a test dataset.

### Inference

To make predictions on new images, you can use the inference script:

```bash
python inference.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
```

This script loads the trained model and classifies the provided image.

## Example

A Jupyter Notebook example (`example.ipynb`) is provided to demonstrate how to use the image classification model step by step. You can run the notebook to see the code and results.
